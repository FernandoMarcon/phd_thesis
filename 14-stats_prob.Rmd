## Statistics

#### Statistical Tests

	Two Categorical Variables

		Checking if two categorical variables are independent can be done with Chi-Squared test of independence.

		This is a typical Chi-Square test: if we assume that two variables are independent, then the values of the contingency table for these variables should be distributed uniformly. And then we check how far away from uniform the actual values are.

		There also exists a Crammer's V that is a measure of correlation that follows from this test

	Categorical vs Numerical Variables

		For this type we typically perform One-way ANOVA test: we calculate in-group variance and intra-group variance and then compare them.
